.SH NAME
pblocks \- modular status bar for dwm and other wm's
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pblocks
.RI [ OPTIONS ]...
.SH DESCRIPTION

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c
path to the configuration file
.TP
.B \-d
delimiter to separate modules
.TP
.B \-D
command to display bar
.RI ( %bar%
will be replaced with bar content)
.TP

.TP
.B \-v
print current version
.SH CONFIGURATION
.P
Configuration file is loaded from
.I ~/.config/pblocks/pblocksrc
unless
.B \-c
is used. Config file must have next format:
.RS
.B <icon> <update interval> <update signal> <command>
.RE
.P
Modules can have
.B unique
signals to update them only then their value changes instead of having them rerun on interval, which is more efficient.
.P
To update module with update signal
.I n
(where n can be from 1 to 22) you need to run
.RS
.B pkill
.BI \-RTMIN+ n
.B \-x pblocks
.RE
.P
Or next command which is faster (where
.IR m = n +34)
.RS
.B kill
.BI \- m
.B $(pidof \-x pblocks)
.RE
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
To setup the volume module with update signal 10 you need to put next command along side your volume bindings, so module will update only when volume changes, instead of constantly checking it's value.
.B pkill \-RTMIN+10 \-x pblocks
.TP
Update dwm bar with xprop instead of xsetroot.
.B pblocks -D 'xprop -root -set WM_NAME """%bar%"""
